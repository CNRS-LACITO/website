Mr. Xu Jirong is the author of a M.A. thesis about the Naxi dialect of
his home village. He told several very brief stories that we used as
part of training in IPA transcription and&nbsp;field
methods: 3 jokes, and the story "Toad child". One of the two versions
of the "Toad child" story is transcribed and translated in full.

            <p class="intertitre">The dialect of the
village of
Guifeng (贵峰;
Naxi: /ndɑ˧le˩/), close to the city of Lijiang, is readily identifiable
by Naxi speakers from neighbouring villages due to tonal inversions,
from H+M to M+H. The narratives presented here were told
in&nbsp;2004
by Mr. HE
Wenjian 和文建.</p>


            
            <p class="intertitre">More narratives were
recorded,
and some
were transcribed; as with many other data sets, the process of
preparation for online archiving is taking a lot of time. It's hard to
find all the time required by&nbsp;these important tasks! In case
you
want to engage in the study of Guifeng Naxi, for an academic thesis
(short Master's thesis or full PhD), please <a href="../../membres/michaud.htm">contact me</a>:
you're very welcome to my full set of recordings. This includes
high-fidelity recordings of word lists made in France with a speaker
who is currently living there. You would be mildly expected to prepare
at least some of the documents for online distribution and archiving,
while using them for learning and research purposes!<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>

With a view to avoiding large discrepancies between the
transcription in International Phonetic Alphabet and the actual
pronunciation, <b>the transcription adopted here is not strictly
phonemic</b>. In particular:</p>


            
            <ul>


              <li>the palatal nasal [ɲ] can be analyzed as an
allophone
of /ŋ/, as can other palatal consonants: [ci] can be analyzed as /ki/,
and so on.</li>


              <li>onset-less syllables receive an
empty-onset-filler:
/i/ is realized as [ʝi], /u/ as [wu], /ɯ/ as [ɣɯ], etc. (This is
similar to Naxi.) These syllables are here transcribed with their
phonetic onset, as [ʝi], [ɣɯ], etc.</li>


            
            </ul>


            
            <p>On the other hand, the apical vowels [ʅ] and [ɿ]
are
phonemicized as /ɯ/. </p>


            
            <p>The following conventions are used for <b>passages
to be added or removed</b> (following Martine Mazaudon's usage
for Tamang):</p>

                  <td>&lt; &gt;</td>


                  <td>angled brackets indicate a 'false start' or

indicated by the speaker when the transcription was done)</td>

            <h2><a name="geagan"></a>Recordings
by Ge A-Gan 戈阿干先生录音资料</h2>


            
            <p> Ge A-Gan, a major figure of Naxi studies, spent
many
years collecting and studying Naxi traditions. When we met in 2011, Ge
A-Gan was aged 75, and in addition to recollecting the many places that
he visited and cultural phenomena that he encountered, he was coming to
reflect more and more upon his own life course, from his childhood in a
Naxi village of the Lijiang plain to a colourful career in the context
of the country's turbulent postwar history, and finally to his old days
spent, again, in that same house where he grew up.</p>


            
            <p>He readily took up the suggestion to record his
life
story. Four Naxi scholars (Yang Jiehong 杨杰红, Yang Junlin 杨军林, He Liu
和柳, and He Wenjian 和文戬) attended the performance, providing an
appreciative and supportive audience. </p>


            
            <p>The first audio file is over one hour long,
containing
an outline of Ge A-Gan's entire career. The second recording focuses on
Naxi to-mba pictographic books. The third is a commented reading of the
first pages of a central ritual in Naxi tradition: the cult of Heaven,
/mɯ˧py˩/.</p>


            
            <p>These three recordings are made freely available
online,
in accordance with the guiding principles of the association "噜噜叭叭 Lulu
Baba" founded by Ge A-Gan for the propagation of Naxi culture for
future inheritance. </p>


            
            <p>Technically, the recordings are in (huge) stereo
sound
files. The audio in the left channel was collected through a Sony
C535EB microphone, and the audio in the right channel through a
Sennheiser head-mounted microphone. These documents have not been
transcribed yet.</p>

            <p>戈阿干，原名和崇仁，纳西族，1936年生于云南省丽江市。1957～1962年就读于中央民族学院历史系。
现为中国民间
文艺家协会会员、中国作家协会会员。自中学时代始就对东巴文化产生了浓厚的兴趣，开始搜集整理纳西族传统民歌，并有作品入选《1957年诗选》，此后长期
专注于东巴文化的研究工作。主要作品有：《祭天古歌》、《格拉茨姆》、《纳西东巴骨卜和象形文骨卜书》、《滇川藏纳西东巴文化及源流考察》、《纳西象形文

The recording of the six songs presented here was generously arranged

Ms. Xiao was aged 73 at the time of recording. <br>


These songs were sung without instrumental accompaniment, and no
digital processing was conducted on the recordings, which remain as
transferred from the original Digital Audio Tape. <br>


            <br>


肖汝莲，是丽江市塔城乡著名纳西族民间歌手。录音时（2002年），肖汝莲女士73岁。肖汝莲女士的儿子，纳西族歌手<a href="http://blog.voc.com.cn/hewenguang" target="_blank">和

the
suggestion of Naxi scholar Guo Dalie, who arranged for me to meet the

generously accepting to do this recording, intended for the
preservation of her voice and its transmission to a large audience; to
Guo Dalie and the Museum of Dongba Culture, for making the recording
possible; and to the Naxi priest He Xuewen for kindly inviting us to do
the recording at his residence within the Museum of Dongba Culture. <br>

            <p>The village of Baidi 白地 is located close to a
spectacular geological site where deposits of calcium carbonate have
created terraces of white pools. This place, 白水台 (White Water

            <p>In late August 2012, Mrs. He Jiezhen 和洁珍 and Mrs.
He
Hong 和虹,
colleagues who have been collecting songs and information about the
to˧mbɑ˩ for years, invited me to come along and see a singing festival
organized by local elderly people (the Elderly Persons' Association of
Sanba: 三坝乡老龄协会). These people gather to perform on several occasions
every year, for their own enjoyment, continuing a long-standing
tradition. </p>


            
            <p>Here is the programme of that day's performance,
as
written down by the
husband of Mrs. Yang Guikai 杨桂开.</p>

piece played on
the cucurbit
flute, 葫芦丝. While the performer played, he walked in circles together
with the rest of the dancers. The left audio channel in the recording
was picked up by a hand-held microphone which I kept pointed in the
performer's direction. The right channel is from a cardioid microphone
that remained in the same position; it gives a sense of the musician's
movement.</p>

song
sung while the
participants were dancing in a circle. The recorder was operating on
battery, so I could be in the middle of the circle. But the battery was
soon too low for operation; at that point I went out of the circle and
resumed recording from one of the sides of the courtyard, where there
was an electric plug. (A colleague had brought a voltage stabilizer to
avoid risks of electric shock to the recorder from the unstable power
grid.) The unrecorded part lasted about half a minute.</p>

            <p align="center"><img alt="A young onlooker watches traditional dances in Baisha, Yunnan" src="../photos/dancers_and_discrete_audience.JPG" width="50%"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>


            
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">While
elderly
people are
performing, a young onlooker smiles from her window in the background.
In thirty or forty years' time, could she become a leading figure
within the Third-Age Association?</span> </p>


            
            <p>The <a href="http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/archivage/tools/show_en.php?id=crdo-NXQ_BAIDIMUSIC_4_SOUND" target="_blank">fourth document</a> is a song also
sung outside while
dancing in a
round, this time to the Lijiang Naxi tune of "A-Li-Li", which as I
understand is a post-1949 creation in the style of Naxi music,
initially used as a means of promotion of the newly-founded PRC's
social norms and mottos.</p>


            
            <p>After this song, everyone went upstairs and took
seats
for the second
part of the festival. Since a couple of years ago, the room (the
meeting room of the former local government; a new government building
is under construction) is equipped with microphones and loudspeakers,
that are now used for occasions like this one. Personally, I would have
preferred to collect voices without intervening electronic devices, but
as this was my first encounter with the people there, I simply sat
where I was instructed to and recorded what was taking place, as it was
taking place, without trying to change the settings chosen by the
organizers.</p>


            
            <p>The loudspeakers are rather obtrusive in the <a href="http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/archivage/tools/show_en.php?id=crdo-NXQ_BAIDIMUSIC_5_SOUND" target="_blank">5th
recording</a>, giving a
rather tinny sound to this song sung by two young women.</p>


            
            <p>All the following sound files, except the 13th,
are
songs in which one
or two persons lead and the entire group repeats their lines. (Link to

            <p>The <a href="http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/archivage/tools/show_en.php?id=crdo-NXQ_BAIDIMUSIC_13_SOUND" target="_blank">13th piece</a> is a song by a young
woman. After a
minute's singing,
she finds herself at a loss, unable to remember what follows; at this
point, Mrs. Yang Guikai cues the forgotten line with great vigour, and
accompanies the singer by clapping her hands until the song is
completed. This example illustrates her sense of responsibility in
passing on the tradition to the young, and her role in helping other
participants surpass themselves, creating and maintaining a lively
atmosphere throughout the day.</p>


            
            <p>The festival started at about 10 a.m. and
continued
until about 2 p.m.
Tea, highland barley wine, cake and fruit were served to the
participants.</p>

            </p>


            
            <p>I was told that at an earlier date these songs
were sung
while working,
during the time-consuming task of preparing hemp for weaving. People
would gather into different age groups, at different places, and work
and sing and drink well until the middle of night, sometimes as late as
three or four in the morning. In this style of singing, anyone can chip
in and sing a simple sentence, which is then taken up by the entire
group</p>


            
            <p align="center">. <img alt="Singing women, Baisha, Yunnan" src="../photos/SingingWomen.JPG" width="50%"></p>


            
            <p>The singing is thus improvised every time.
Recurrent themes in singing include the beauty of nature: mountains,
rivers, sun and moon, clouds, flowers, birds and horses, as well as the
pleasure of being together and the charm of voices from near and afar. </p>


            
            <p>In times when occasions to meet were few in these
hemmed-in locations,
these festivals were momentous social occasions. The radiant smile on
the face of some older singers makes me think that that day's festival
revived fond memories. </p>


            
            <p>(The third person from the right is Mrs Yang
Guikai 杨桂开,
whose vigorous
and clear voice stands out in the recordings.)</p>


            
            <p align="center"><img src="../photos/Baidi_elderly_men.JPG" alt="Elderly men at a music festival, Baidi, Yunnan" width="40%"><br>

            </p>


            
            <p>Speeches were delivered after the 5th musical
piece.
Quite predictably,
the young were scolded in absentia for their lack of interest in
learning these styles of singing. Some of the speeches were provocative
indeed, so much so that we finally decided to omit all speeches from
the two CDs that I prepared from the recordings, and that Mrs. He
Jiezhen and Mrs. He Hong reproduced and later distributed to all the
participants, with some photos of the event. </p>


            
            <p>Mrs. He Jiezhen and Mrs. He Hong, clothed in local
Naxi
garments that
had been lent to them, took notes and pictures.</p>


            
            <p align="center"><img alt="Lijiang Naxi visitors at a music festival in Baisha, Yunnan" src="../photos/LijiangVisitors_photo.JPG" width="40%"><br>


            </p>


            
            <p>From a technical point of view, the recording has
some
obvious
shortcomings. This was my first outdoor recording, and for want of
appropriate wind shields for the microphones, one can occasionally hear
wind noises. Upstairs, I simply placed both microphones (certainly much
too close to each other) in the same stand, on a sofa, as there were
strong vibrations in the wooden floor as people shuffled their feet on
the floor and walked to and fro. Had I had more time I could have hung
the microphones from the ceiling, but again as this was my first
contact it was perhaps just as well that my microphones and recorder
were visually unobtrusive.</p>


            
            <p>Needless to say, traditions are changing. For
instance,
the organizers
had required participants to indicate in advance what they would like
to sing; their lines were taken down in writing, in Chinese
translation. During the festival, Mrs. Yang Guikai's husband announced
the performers according to the list. </p>


            
            <p align="center"><img alt="Translation of first three songs at a music festival in Baidi, Yunnan" src="../photos/TranslationOfFirstThreeSongs.JPG" width="50%"><br>


            </p>


            
            <p>This allows a fair time slot to each, and
incidentally
facilitates the
work of researchers documenting the festival and transcribing the
songs; but it detracts slightly from the spontaneousness of the event. </p>


            
            <p>This festival was not staged for the tourist
industry;
indeed, no
single tourist was present at the performance. This is a strong
contrast from the old town of Lijiang, now mercilessly deprecated as a
"tourist zoo" by visitors disappointed by the endless row of shops,
mostly manned by newly arrived merchants, that occupy the old-style
buildings of the Naxi capital. </p>


            
            <p>A sizeable team from Tianjin TV had come to the
village
for this
occasion, as part of a documentary they were preparing about local
culture; they took video recordings of the outdoor dances. </p>


            
            <p align="center"><img alt="A team from Tianjin TV films a music festival in Baidi, Yunnan" src="../photos/Baidi_DancingInARound.JPG" width="50%"><br>


            </p>


            
            <p>Upstairs, there were only village people, plus the
three
visitors from
Lijiang: Mrs. He Jiezhen, Mrs. He Hong and myself.</p>


            
            <p>It is uncertain what the event will look like in
future
years. I hope
it will still be there in another generation. Great change is likely to
take place when a better road is built, connecting the village with
Lijiang; when we went there, the trip lasted 9 hours by bus, going
through Zhongdian 中甸, a city recently renamed "Shangri-La", after the
name of a fictitious city in <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500141h.html" target="_blank">an early-20th century novel by English
writer James Hilton</a>. It
is certainly a great challenge for the group who shared that day's
great performance with us to manage the impending tourist boom. </p>


            
            <p>As we took a walk to the White Water Terraces, two
Naxi
schoolboys
offered to sing Naxi songs to us, for a fee. This sounded like a neat
coincidence, and a good opportunity to see what kind of songs they
knew. They first asked, "How much do you pay?" We told them we'd rather
they sang first and we'd then give what we thought it was worth. One,
two, three, and they started singing... a song in Chinese. It turned
out they did not know a single Naxi song or nursery rhyme.</p>


            
            <p align="center"><img alt="Naxi schoolboys in Baidi, Yunnan" src="../photos/Schoolboys.JPG" width="60%"></p>


            
            <p align="center">(Photo: He Hong 和虹)</p>


            
            <p>From a linguistic point of view, the Naxi dialect
of
Baidi looks well
worth exploring in great depth. Ms. He Jiezhen has some familiarity
with this dialect from being in touch with people from this area, and
she can understand most of what is being said. The tool that she uses
for transcription, however, is the romanization ('Naxi Pinyin', 纳西语拼音)
created for 'Standard Naxi': in other words, she has to translate the
texts into her own dialect as she transcribes, somewhat as if someone
transcribed "I ain't got no children" as "I have no children". </p>


            
            <p align="center"><img alt="Transcription of Naxi songs as they are being sung. Baidi, Yunnan" src="../photos/HeJiezhenTranscribing.JPG" width="50%"><br>


            </p>


            
            <p>This is enough to preserve the meaning of the
songs, and
part of their
flavour. But a linguist would of course want to have a description of
this language variety on its own terms. Such a description requires
about six months' work on the part of a trained linguist; as I am
currently doing my best to produce this type of in-depth work for
Yongning Na, I can't afford to start working on it myself. The dialect
sounds pretty different from that of another village in the same
township: Ciending (三坝乡东坝村次恩丁自然村), which I came to study through
collaboration with a Naxi student at Yunnan University: Xu Jirong (a
fully transcribed and annotated recording of the Ciending dialect is
available here, and a phonemic analysis, with a word list, is available
here). I hope that someone will be able to produce an in-depth analysis
of the Baidi dialect; as elsewhere, schooling and the media expose the
children to more Chinese than Naxi. </p>


            
            <p>After the festival was over, Mrs. He Jiezhen and
Mrs. He
Hong went to
interview two to˧mbɑ˩ priests. One of them, Mr. He Zhiben 和志本, aged 85,
confided his feeling that there was no way the cultural heritage of the
Naxi rituals and the pictographic books could be passed on any further,
since such dramatic changes had taken place. He cheerfully added that
he was glad some of it could be recorded, "because it is really quite
something".</p>
