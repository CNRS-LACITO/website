            Throughout history, approximately 30% of all coats of arms are canting ones. Some consider that canting arms are a recent innovation, an error which was unfortunately compounded by the 1696 Armorial census.<br>
This presentation aims both to demonstrate that canting arms were present at the dawn of heraldry (circa 1150), throughout society, and to explain the difference between &quot;rebus arms&quot; and arms alluding to history or politics, linked to the manner in which people considered themselves (as individuals, descendants of a line or a political group…) and usually linked to the mother tongue of the arms bearer.

            <strong><a href="http://chdt.ehess.fr/document.php?id=306" target="_blank">Galia Valtchinova</a></strong> (Bulgarian Academy of Science) – <strong>Vidi mi se preko slava </strong>[ceci apparaît à moi par la gloire (de Dieu)]<strong> : expériences de femmes visionnaires de Macédoine  (FYRoM) entre le non-dit et le sous-entendu<br>
</strong>[<strong>Vidi mi se preko slava [this is made apparent to me by the glory (of God)]: the experiences of Macedonian visionary women (FYRoM), between implicit and implied</strong>]<br>
            &quot;Vidi mi se preko slava&quot; is a ritualized formula used to refer to contact between humans and one or several supernatural entities having chosen the human to act as a conduct or &quot;mouthpiece&quot; for the supernatural entity. For the orthodox female visionaries of the Republic of Macedonia, a small Balkan state, formerly part of Yugoslavia, where the fieldwork upon which this talk is based was carried out between 1999 and 2004, this formula expresses the heart of the relation between vision and prophecy. Supernatural entities can be saints, angels, the Virgin Mary or Jesus Christ, or deceased family members or prominent members of society. The general label &quot;supernatural entities&quot; comes from the fact that locally all of these figures are seen and perceived as obeying a superhuman will intervening in the life of humans. However, whether holy or secular, these supernatural actors are rarely, if ever, named. Contrary to visionaries in Catholic cultures who may often be heard to exclaim &quot;the Virgin is here!&quot;, ethnographers will have no such luck in Macedonia. The divine, or more generally the supernatural, entity to which the visionary submits herself and in whose name she &quot;speaks&quot; in announcing revelations or prophecies, can only be identified after a painstaking process on the part of the visionary, of comparing her utterances with the implicit cultural information which she has integrated and elements which seem &quot;obvious&quot; to her, which I call &quot;implied&quot; here. The explicit references to slava, the Slavic term for &quot;glory&quot;, &quot;celebration&quot; and &quot;divine grace&quot; in visionary formulations, are used to attempt to read and understand the implied and implicit elements of the visionaries in the local ritual culture.</p>

The goal of this talk is to analyze how the griot, a genealogist and historian (jasare), through his narrative at the wedding, managed to implicitly create a battle of wills with the recipient of his narrative, despite the fact that in Zarma hierarchy, she was his superior. To explain how an &quot;inferior&quot; managed to overturn a situation which at first glance was not in his favor, I attempted to discover the traps he laid for his listeners, and got caught up in the quest for understanding how narrators implicate themselves, whether implicitly or explicitly, in their narrations.</p>

            </strong>[<strong>Double entendre and the dialogic structuring of discourse: singing speech in Calypso (Trinidad)</strong>]<br>
            According to Trinidadians, the Calypso drinking songs illustrate the double entendre: an ordinary storyline with &quot;erotic&quot; undertones. The poetics of the double entendre in Calypso drinking songs are based on various processes: musical, semantic, pragmatic, communicational; from the listener's perspective, understanding these processes is very simple, but only if one has mastered local manners of speaking. What does one need to know to hear and understand the puns in Calypso? Much on the local linguistic codes (standard English Trinidadian, urban and rural Anglophone Creoles, etc.), and even more on the art of indirect speech illustrated by daily Trinidad rhetoric. This presentation is based on examples from Calypso. It also proposes revisiting some of Mikhaïl Bakhtine's ideas.</p>

            </strong>[<strong>Avoiding language names: the dilemma of those who speak the disappearing languages of Greece</strong>]<br>
            When one investigates speakers' epilinguistic discourse and the names they use to refer to &quot;the language they speak&quot;, one finds elliptic denominations, highlighting the taboo surrounding the very existence of these languages. This is the case e.g. of Nashta, a Southern Slavic and Arvanitic language which is only referred to in speech as &quot;it&quot; (the language) as in &quot;he doesn't speak it&quot;, in Greek <em>dhen ta kseri</em> and in Arvanite <em>nuk e di</em>; &quot;you don't understand it?&quot;, Greek <em>ta katalavenis</em>? <br>
            The question one can ask is, is this the interiorization of the silence reflected in official discourse and dominant ideology? Or is it rather provoked by unhealed wounds caused by the fact that it is forbidden to speak these languages? It may also be caution while waiting to see where the speaker is going and what name he or she will use to refer to these languages.</p>

            <strong><a href="../membres/randa.htm">Vladimir Randa</a></strong> &ndash; <strong>Termes de substitution pour nommer les animaux chez les Inuit (niveaux de langue profane, chamanique et po&eacute;tique)<br>
            </strong>[<strong>Substitute names to refer to animals among the Inuit (language registers: secular, shamanic, poetic)</strong>]<br>
            Formerly, the Inuit had various social and linguistic processes governing language use in ritual contexts which demanded particular vigilance: gestation, menorrhagia, still births, birthing, sickness, death; one's first successful hunt; shamanic initiation. One of the processes used consisted in using substitute terms to name the various realities, especially animals, particularly important for societies which survive by hunting. These terms constitute what is commonly called the &quot;shamanic lexicon&quot;, even though they were in no way exclusively used by shamans, but were instead descriptive terms referring to semantic meanings relevant for Inuit culture.        <br>
            There is an additional mechanism which is similar but used for different purposes (esthetic or emotional). As far as it is possible to say, given that the forms are not frozen, lay language uses the same processes.  <br>
            There are links between the various language registers: one dialect's &quot;shamanic&quot; term can crop up in a different dialect as a lay term. The same term can refer to two different animals depending on whether it is used in a ritual or in ordinary songs.  Another issue which must be addressed is the motivation behind the terms used, i.e. their foundation in the naturalist experience of the Inuit speakers.</p>

            Set expressions can be a way of not saying things explicitly but nonetheless being understood by one's listeners. This is often the case in West Africa, where proverbs are widely used. We have used our different origins – Malian for one, French for the other – to explore this interculturality through a pragmatic approach to communication, in order to understand exactly when speakers choose to use proverbs, especially when such use can lead to incomprehension on the listener's part. </p>

            </strong>[<strong>What is said, or not, about the Saracen in the Chanson de Roland?</strong>]<br>
            The Chanson de Roland is a classic of Medieval French epic literature. Some of the characters it contains can be clearly identified, some are imaginary. It narrates a historical event which took place at the end of the 8th century. The manuscript, called the Oxford manuscript, as that where it is preserved, dates from the 12th century. The language used in the text is considered by linguists and philologists to date back to the 11th century. The text describes, through 4001 verses, the representatives of the Saracen people as enemies, pagans, traitors, possessors of great material riches, hypocrites, powerful beings, miscreants, etc.. In what way does this discourse, both ancient and perennial, partake in what is implicit, said or left unsaid? To explain what is said, we will base ourselves on both form and semantics. Moreover, the analysis will be based on work in historical anthropological studies on the Saracens, to determine how Others and Muslims were revealed in the epics. We will further examine the text to highlight any possible correspondences between what is said and what is implicit, or perhaps discover a hiatus between what is said and what is not.</p>

            What lies behind the words inscribed on the plaques commemorating the Liberation of Paris? Of course the words written on these plaques: name, date, and especially &quot;here fell…&quot;, inform the reader of a mortal event, but how is the link to the Liberation of Paris established? Moreover, behind the words &quot;here fell&quot; ends the life of a man or a woman. So is a commemorative plaque the beginning of a necrology or is it rather the story of someone's life in reduced form? One also notes that reference to the enemy changes over time, from Boche to Nazi to German. What is this implicit evolution of the diplomatic relations between France and Germany? Lastly, what implicit information do the location and environment of the commemorative plaques furnish on the event, and how should one interpret it?</p>

            </strong>[<strong>On how the Batammariba avoid names (Togo, Benin)</strong>]<br>
            The Batammariba in Togo and Benin are extremely careful not to say their own names out loud, nor those of their family members, whether living or deceased. From birth, each person is given several names. Some names, nicknames in particular, can be spoken freely, and the same is true for 'ranking' names (the eldest, the youngest…), terms of address (mother, father…) and &quot;joyous names&quot;, bestowed by foreigners or family allies. Inversely, the true or &quot;suffering name&quot; is only spoken on rare occasions, because it is the name which corresponds to a person's &quot;breath&quot; or soul. After death, the name is kept secret.</p>

            </strong>[<strong>Politeness and verbal violence in Oceania</strong>]<br>
            Verbal violence, whether it is expressed directly or in a more insidious manner, through not respecting codes of etiquette in verbal exchanges, is often considered more aggressive than physical violence.        <br>
            In Oceania, this verbal violence takes on specific forms, in the choice of insults, swear words, threats, or the use of taboo words. In Polynesia for example, insults belong to two very particular semantic fields: smells and birth ranks, while in New Caledonia, insults are more often of a sexual nature.<br>

            This presentation follows up on that given on the 29th of June 2006, on &quot;Translating the implicit – the Moroccan Arab tradition&quot;. It has broached the various periphrases used in North African societies. We have examined instances linked to sexuality and love, fear of the invisible and protecting oneself against hidden forces, word magic, curses… We have analyzed the processes by which these periphrases are put into words. Implicit elements and translation have also been explored from these different angles.</p>

            </strong>[<strong>Zoological metaphors in Circassian-Kabarde and in Russian</strong>]<br>
            Zoological metaphors have polysemous meanings based on metaphoric ties. Their study enables the analysis not only of comparative linguistic problems (Kabard-Circassian, Russian, French) but also the cultural context linked to these languages and their specific world views. We will attempt to understand the means the language uses to transmit supra-linguistic realities, and how languages go about producing cognitive images.        <br>
            We will address the following questions:<br>
- What role do zoological metaphors play in the secret language of hunters, and in that of the Circassian horsemen?        <br>
- What are the causes behind the taboos and avoidance strategies used by Circassian hunters?<br>
- Today, are zoological metaphors often used in every day discourse?<br>
- What is the evocative potential of metaphors?</p>

            The video footage shows a caboclos celebration in a Salvador candomblé center. After the manifestation of the orixás accompanied by Yoruba chants, the caboclos come, to the sound of Portuguese canticles, to purify the location using bunches of sacred leaves. My analysis will explore the implicit side to the ceremony and the songs which accompany it. As Yoruba is no longer spoken in Brazil, the chants in the language are reinterpreted.</p>

            </strong>[<strong>Pacts with the devil among the Purhépecha (Mexico); implicit and omitted elements</strong>]<br>
            Among the Purhépecha (Mexico), oral tradition texts narrating the road from rags to riches highlight three recurrent modes of acquiring immediate riches: i) capturing a &quot;supernatural being&quot; (familiar-japínhwa) ; ii) signing a pact with the devil; iii) finding a hidden treasure. We will explore the second possibility here, in the light of the implicit elements and presuppositions (the first road to immediate riches was already explored in an earlier presentation on rites of passage and initiations).<br>
In stories concerning pacts with the devil, the narration which links the story teller to his or her audience, the devil to his debtors, is strategic. It takes everyone in, mixing them up in a recreation of uninterrupted speech, suggestiveness, omissions. Taking one of these stories, we will broach the various forms of silence, starting in particular with the presuppositions underlying the cultural usage which give meaning to the world. Then, studying the various texts which take up the same theme, we will study in more detail some of the underlying bases to these omissions: censorship, relevance, self-images, interpretation, imagination, intentionality, experience, putting things into action, etc.. The devil, that historical figure of radical otherness, will furnish the means to grasp all the ambiguity in these omissions or forgotten elements, whether essential or accessory elements, willingly left out or not, consciously or unconsciously omitted.<br>
            - <strong>Rachida&nbsp; El Ghannami</strong> (University of Montreal) &ndash; <strong>Traduire l'implicite - tradition arabe marocaine<br>
            </strong>[<strong>Translating implicit elements – the Moroccan Arabic tradition</strong>]<br>
            The corpus studied consists of oral tradition texts narrated by elderly women in Morocco. The translation of these texts raised the following issues:<br>
How does one translate stories knowing that they belong to a specific socio-cultural universe and that to translate them means translating a reality which is both implicit and ever-present? How does one translate oral speech? In other words, how does one translate speech, which is formed as it happens, being corrected and completed along the way? How does one interpret and then translate everything that instead of being said was rather left to the hearer's understanding; or things that were said, but in a roundabout manner?        <br>
Since meaning stems from both explicit and implicit elements, my translations had to render not only what was said, but also what was just alluded to in passing. It was inconceivable to translate the texts without giving some idea of the socio-cultural context and the underlying elements implied by it. Speech between two people from a same culture always implies a certain number of shared hypotheses on the world. Their shared knowledge (on religion, the culture, social facts, belief systems…) allows them to encode and decode messages in a certain manner.<br>
Much of the meaning contained in my corpus was based on cultural givens. A translation based solely on the words, without filling in the blanks, would have been incomprehensible and would not have truly reflected the original. However, even though switching from one language to another implies reinterpreting the original text, the translation can only imperfectly furnish the culturally implicit elements. This presentation provides some of the processes used to render the implicit elements and my ongoing work will further explore this orientation.</p>

            </strong>[<strong>How things can be said differently? Bafia proverbs (Cameroon)</strong>]<br>
            Proverbs furnish rich materials for the study of indirect communication, allowing speakers to convey a very strong message without overly implicating themselves. Bafia proverbs use all sorts of deviations. They often adopt impersonal pronouns (&quot;one&quot;) referring to anybody and everybody, and which serve to transmit truths which are deemed obvious by social conventions. Another common device is to attribute the speech to a third party, a specific character or a being from the natural surroundings, often an animal, and to refer to specific character traits of these beings, which is a way of saying certain things implicitly. Lastly, symbolic equivalencies are set up, making it necessary to decode the meaning to understand the proverb's message. Because there are common patterns, variations in form and meaning may appear in each specific discourse situation.</p>

            </strong>[<strong>Implicit elements in a ritual which was not respected: the example of a &quot;pomana&quot; performed by Romanians in Serbia</strong>]<br>
            This work is based on the field recording in eastern Serbia of a <em>pomana</em> (a meal given in honor of the souls of deceased people on the anniversary of their death). On this occasion, a large number of rites and rules must be carried out in a very precise manner, to ensure the soul's well being in the after world. However, on this specific day, certain rituals were omitted. The extract under study shows the reaction of two elderly ladies, in charge of making sure that tradition is respected. However, they are faced with a dilemma, because it is forbidden to voice any criticism on the day of a <em>pomana</em>, as it can harm the deceased. How did these two elderly women manage to show disapproval for the way the ceremony was carried out, without themselves acting contrary to the tradition it was their task to uphold? The linguistic analysis presented here explores the discourse strategies devised to say without saying.</p>

            This is a general overview of personal research, based on both unpublished and published works (<em>L'Effet injure</em>, 1983, Paris, PUF.<em> L'injure à fleur de peau</em>, 1993, Paris, L'Harmattan.<em> Injure et sexualité</em>, 1997, Paris, PUF) which constitutes a sort of theory on the effects of insults where insults are taken in their fundamentally relational dimension. This dimension is often forgotten because of the lexicon's attractiveness and seductive nature. A collective volume will also be presented:<em> L'injure, la société, l'islam</em>, 2004, <em>REMMM</em> 103-104. This volume is a first step in the creation of an &quot;Anthropology of insults&quot;, following the same pragmatic approach.</p>

            Discussion around the article by<strong> <a href="../membres/lebarbier.htm">Micheline Lebarbier</a> &quot;Les dires du conte, L'exemple de quelques contes fac&eacute;tieux roumains&quot;</strong>, to launch the theme on &quot;what is said, left unsaid, or implicit&quot;.<br>
            The study of a corpus of 97 facetious Romanian stories underscores the differences in the discourse the narrators produce within the same story (situations dwelt on complacently by some, barely mentioned by others). At times this happens to such an extent that a story may become the backdrop for another story, namely that of the narrator, with the narrator not always even being aware of it.        <br>
            This study also brings to light the fact that some situations, more particularly female adultery, are always presented metaphorically. These variations, detours, and various ways of &quot;not saying&quot;, are very revealing: of the society, of the narrator and of the latter's position in the group.<br>
