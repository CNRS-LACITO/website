      <p>In this research group, our objective was first to review the various methodologies applied to understand lexical stability and variation, from both a linguistic and a socio-cultural perspective. Our observations were based on case studies of written and oral data, analyzed with manual and automatic techniques. We then attempted to discern the socio-cultural factors behind the lexical changes, by examining concrete situations which were synthesized and divided into various types.</p>
      <p>The questions raised were the following:<br>
- what lies behind the idea of a proto-language, and of what use is the reconstruction of roots for historical reconstitution?<br>
- by comparison, what in dynamic synchrony corresponds to diachronic factors?<br>
etc. </p>
      <p>On a linguistic level, it is important to differentiate between similarities which are due to a common ancestor and those which are due to contact. This cannot be done using lexico-statistics. However, contact which took place in the far past cannot always be distinguished from common ancestry, especially as languages may have several ancestors.</p>
      <p>Reconstructing a proto-language can provide information as to the community of people speaking the hypothetical language – where and when they lived, as well as some of their cultural features. An example of this is furnished by Y. Monino (LLACAN) in his restitution of migrations and proto-semantics. His approach, like that of the following presentation, adds to our knowledge of the past of societies with no writing systems. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, diachronic studies in dynamic synchrony may take into account convergence and divergence, thereby making it possible to determine which elements were inherited from the proto language and which are due to language contact, by calculating which elements are jointly retained and which are shared outside of any retention. Thus one may deduce osmosis systems at different periods along with their characteristic semantics. Once again more or less ancient migrations, contacts and common trunks can be deduced.</p>
      <p>Historical linguistics, based on written documents, is a more certain way of examining borrowings and contact, the paths followed by various terms, and the interactions between linguistic change and socio-cultural circles. This is demonstrated through the study of the evolution of Old French heraldic language on one hand and Arabisms on the other.      </p>
      <p>Computer assisted reconstructions are very useful for establishing phonetic and phonological correspondences, thanks to the large quantities of data they can process. However, such reconstructions have difficulty establishing stable hypotheses, and processing semantic and socio-cultural information. However, if one limits their use to listing cognates, reconstruction formulae, and the historical data on the socio-cultural contexts, they can be used, as proposed by P. Boyeldieu and P. Nougayrol (LLACAN) as tools to facilitate data sorting, research processes and determining lexical layerings. This is the conclusion reached by S. de Pury (CELIA).</p>
      <p>Determining the implications of the various methodologies used in diachrony provided an opportunity to explore their possible contributions and limitations for grasping socio-cultural contexts. In the future, to typify the factors behind change garnered through case studies, we will return to a more open stance. Lexical changes are far from being linguistically autonomous and constant. Instead, they depend on exchanges linked to geographical organization, politics, economics and the society, demography and cultural contexts, i.e. the entire cognitive domain anchored in human experience, in all its dimensions: perception, practices, techniques, material and cultural manifestations. </p>

            Taking the example of the Pidgin/Creole Bislama, a code only two centuries old, J.-M. Charpentier studies the determining influence of demographic and socio-economic factors on the lexicon. This idiom’s morphological complexification and semantic enrichment took place in parallel to the evolution of the society and changes in its political status: from double colonization (British and French) to independent State. All of these changes have taken place since the end of World War 2, and are therefore relatively easy to study. These factors make Bislama’s sociolinguistic situation highly original.<br>

            <strong>[Problems raised by the study of zoonyms and phytonyms; from Kantharis to cantharid, several millennia of apparent lexical stability ] </strong><br>
            For several millennia, cantharides were the most widely used medicinal insect in Europe and the Mediterranean countries. Until recently, this beetle was particularly sought after for its vesicatory properties (it was applied to the skin to induce rashes and vesicles), as a diuretic, etc. Today, numerous websites extol its use as an aphrodisiac, despite its lethalness.<br>
            We will follow the evolution of this drug&rsquo;s name, from &ldquo;kantharis&rdquo; in the Hippocratic Collection written in the 5th century B.C. to &ldquo;cantharide&rdquo; in the 2007 edition of the Littré. However, its designation is only apparently stable and many twists and turns have been imposed by the contexts and stakes of local histories. These are all elements which must be studied in order to fully understand medicinal products.<br>
            This example will also provide an opportunity to explore some of the difficulties one faces in studying the diachrony and synchrony of zoonyms and phytonyms.</p>

            <strong>[Swahili lexicography and diachrony] </strong><br>
            The earliest works on Swahili lexicography date back to the mid 19th century. All of the dictionaries produced were bilingual (Swahili-English, English-Swahili and Swahili-French, French-Swahili). This bilingual tradition dominated Swahili lexicography until 1981, when the first monolingual Swahili dictionary was published. This was the first monolingual dictionary to be published on an African language.<br>
            My talk proposes a study of the history of words relating to the constantly changing cultural environment. We will also explore examples from the Swahili-French dictionary I am currently compiling. </p>

            <br>
              </strong> The<em> SBB Lexicon</em> is a comparative data base which illustrates cognate series (i.e. terms which are historically related) for 30 languages belonging to a single genealogical group spoken in central Africa. These languages constitute the Central Sudanic branch (Greenberg&rsquo;s Nilo-Saharan phylum). <br>
 This database, initially compiled in Shoebox, was reprocessed by G. Segerer (LLACAN) to make it searchable and usable on the Internet (<a href="http://sumale.vjf.cnrs.fr/SBB/" target="_blank">http://sumale.vjf.cnrs.fr/SBB/</a>).<br>
 It is made up of:<br>
 • an introductory text (languages and their contexts, genealogies, correspondences, historical depth indices, bibliographies, etc.) <br>
 • a &ldquo;lexicon&rdquo; file (cognates and reconstruction formulae), paired with a &ldquo;comments&rdquo; file (translations, formal observations, etc.) <br>
 • a &ldquo;correspondences&rdquo; file, setting out in detail the consonantal, vocalic and tonal correspondences which served as the basis for the identification of the cognates present in the lexicon. Perusal of the &ldquo;lexicon&rdquo; and &ldquo;correspondence&rdquo; files is enhanced by the possibility of narrowing down display to specific elements by choosing specific domains, setting filters, and using sort functions<br>
 The <em>SBB Lexicon</em> is not an automatic reconstruction tool (the cognates are established using historical comparison principles, with manual searches in lexicons and dictionaries). The aim of the lexicon is to present comparative data with a view to documentary and research uses, on the lexicon and its history.<br>
 During this session, the <em>SBB Lexicon</em> is illustrated through the main search and sort functions, illustrating the principles of lexical stratigraphy.</p>

            <strong>[Issues in diachronic Arabic and Berber lexicology, languages with &lsquo;visible&rsquo; consonant skeletons]</strong> <br>
            This talk is divided into two parts. In the first, we will discuss the notion of root as it is understood in Chamito-Semitic languages. I will explain the expression used for lack of a better one in the title: &ldquo;languages with &lsquo;visible&rsquo; consonant skeletons&rdquo;. This distinction harks back to that established by David Cohen between &ldquo;word languages&rdquo; and &ldquo;root languages&rdquo;. According to this definition, many languages have no roots (contrary to what is implied by conflation between &ldquo;root&rdquo; and &ldquo;etymon&rdquo;). We will see how roots work in a language such as Arabic, their role in organizing the lexicon and the tight links which bind the root to the more or less frozen forms, which are called patterns [schemes] by traditional western scholars of Arabic.<br>
            In the second part, we will study the evolution of certain roots and patterns, taking examples from both Arabic and Berber. In Arabic, the consonant changes are almost always regular, while those found in Berber (established through cross dialectal comparison) are much less so. This makes comparison difficult, not only for purposes of studying the semantic evolution and the history of the lexicon, but also for reconstruction.</p>

            <strong><a href="../../membres/quinsat.htm">Fran&ccedil;oise Quinsat</a> &ndash; Lexicologie historique de l'arabe [A historical lexicography of Arabic]</strong><br>
            Arabic historical lexicography is based on the same rules and methods as those used for languages not having as large a collection of historical written documents covering a wide time span, e.g. Romance and Germanic languages. <br>
  However, the history and workings of Arabic are such that the historical methods used to study the lexicon are very language specific for the following reasons: <br>
   a) the fact that the texts reputed to be most ancient, i.e. pre-Islamic poetry and the Koran, have only recently been inventoried; <br>
  b) diglossia between written Arabic, also called literal or Classical… and local spoken varieties;<br>
  c) the absence of a tradition of language study, coupled with the overwhelming number of dictionaries, lexicographic works and lexicographies, almost none of which provide reliable or explicit chronological data, with the notable exception of two recent dictionaries, which unfortunately are largely unfinished. This makes it difficult to unearth the various lexicographic layers and to understand the lexicon&rsquo;s evolution. Most Arabic dictionaries and lexicological studies only partially and sketchily apply the rigorous and well-tested methods of historical lexicology. <br>
   Because of this, the particularities of historical Arabic lexicography raise the question of how the field could assimilate the methods and processes used for reconstructing the lexicons and histories of oral tradition languages. To answer this question, I will present several case studies which illustrate such questions and the problems that must be answered through minute lexicological studies of several representative Arabic lexical units. We will attempt to describe their etymology, determine the moment when they appeared in the language, their evolution over time and space, their morphological, phonetic, sociolinguistic variation, etc., from a diachronic perspective. The historical methods used for this diachronic study of the linguistic object &lsquo;lexicon&rsquo; will then be compared, or even confronted, with the issues raised by the methods and questions proper to diachronic studies where historiographic resources are unavailable. </p>

            <strong><a href="../../membres/colombel.htm">V&eacute;ronique de Colombel</a> &ndash; Lexique naturaliste du tchadique central et diachronie</strong><br>
            <strong>[Diachrony and the Central Chadic naturalist lexicon] </strong><br>
            One cannot take the Central Chadic botanical and zoological lexicons and immediately trace them back to their Akkadian and Aramaic forms, as they are not known. This can only be done with personal pronouns with standardized and frozen forms, were information is available. It is nevertheless possible to reconstruct roots or shared forms for plant and animal names, which makes it possible to establish intra-Chadic or extra-Chadic common trees, with information on their semantics. To do so, it is necessary to taken into account roots, phonetic changes, periods of overlapping identical terms, whereby one may differentiate between older and newer borrowings in their cultural context. Because to understand contact dynamics, one must take into consideration the implications of the plants and animals in the society of the time and in the exchanges between societies. We therefore adopted an ethnolinguistic approach, and analyzed the diachrony as successive dynamic synchronies, to establish the characteristics of the inherited elements and exchanges in the Central Chadic group. Our analyses are primarily based on fieldwork carried out in the Mandaras Mountains and on the shores of Lake Chad.</p>

            <strong>Yves Mo&ntilde;ino</strong> (LLACAN) &ndash; <strong>&Eacute;volution lexicale et histoire culturelle : le cas du proto-gbaya</strong><br>
            <strong>[Lexical evolution and cultural history: the case of Proto-Gbaya]            </strong><br>
            In linguistic evolution, it is important to make a clear distinction, using rigorous methodological criteria, between resemblances due to common inheritance and those due to language contact (in Manessy&rsquo;s terms, &ldquo;genealogical kinship&rdquo; and &ldquo;genetic kinship&rdquo; respectively). Lexical-statistic methods alone cannot serve to establish this distinction as nothing travels so much as vocabulary, even so-called &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; vocabulary. It is especially important to respect this scientific rigor in areas where one finds speakers of several languages with a common ancestor who have long been in a situation of contact. I will briefly present the methodology as applied to the comparison and reconstruction of the Proto-Gbaya linguistic structures, and will mention the deductions which can be made from analyzing the reconstructed vocabulary as to when the speakers of the hypothetical language lived, as well as the community&rsquo;s cultural specificities.</p>
