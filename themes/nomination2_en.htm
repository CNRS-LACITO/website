            [The transmission of &quot;given family names&quot; in contemporary England</strong>]<br>
            The baptism registers of the (Anglican) parish of Bakewell, Derbyshire, covering the period from 1973 to 1998 show a recurrent feature in the choice of first names: almost one third of boys baptized were given their father's name as a first, second or third first name, the father's name in question being the father's first, second or third first name. This phenomenon applies much less to mothers and daughters. This observation led me to investigate naming usage and genealogies in ten families in the area. The data collected confirms the forms of homonymy found in the parish registers. The interpretation of these practices refers to other registers, namely <br>
            – spiritual kinship inherited from the Reform, <br>
            – social organization (relatives, inheritance), <br>
            – temporality.</p>

            [Kinship terms and semantic category transfer in Salomon Islands Pijin]</strong><br>
            The kinship terminology used in Pijin, the vehicular language of the Salomon Islands, is a simplified version of the Hawaiian kinship type and is, generally speaking, simpler than the kinship systems found in the Salomon societies. Two observations may be made: first, the Pijin kinship categories do not appear to be perfect copies of those found in the vernacular languages. Second, the terminology has undergone recent changes, especially in urban settings. A series of questions will serve as a thread for the analysis presented in this presentation: what is the nature of the resemblances and differences found between the Pijin kinship terminologies and those of the local vernaculars? What social and cultural transformations led to the changes in the Pijin kinship terminology? And finally, in light of the case study findings presented here, what is the role of the cultural dimension in the transfer of semantic categories?</p>

            [Naming in Arama (New-Caledonia). Structures and choices]</strong> <br>
            In Arama, society is marked by the preeminence of relations – typical in Melanesia. Relations are highlighted through differentiation, but may also, more specifically, be marked by strong semanticization. The fact that names partake in this semanticization of social relations can seem surprising, as in the West, numerous linguists distinguish between common nouns, considered to have meaning, and proper, meaningless, names. Here however, whether it be in their creation or in the meanings accompanying them, names of people and of social entities condense meanings. Alongside these considerations on the semanticization of relations and names, i.e. their strong links to language usage, this study will highlight other important principles in the naming system. The temporal dynamics between generations promotes this system. In contrast, the least promoted sectors of the naming system indicate areas open to choice and creativity. The naming system is composed of these two extremities.</p>

            <strong>Florence Dupr&eacute;</strong> &ndash;<strong>&nbsp;Nominations et relations à Sanikiluaq : anthroponymie dynamique dans une communauté inuit nord-canadienne <br>
            [Naming and relations in Sanikiluaq: dynamic anthroponymy in a north Canadian community]<br>
              </strong>For over 50 years, Inuit studies have examined place names, and these are still a surprising area of contact between evolving anthroponymy and shifting relational universes. Linked to the permanence of certain transmission modalities of given names from one generation to the next, the reproduction of this system, governed both by the status and the aura of the final &quot;atiq&quot; bearer (the nominal instance), is implicated in a set of relational practices which have as yet been little studied.<br>
            This presentation is based on data gathered during two field trips to Sanikiluaq (an Inuit community of the Canadian Nunavut), and will attempt to demonstrate the existence of a true relational network created around children, in which contemporary naming and parental terminology play a major role. We will consider the eponymic system as a relational system structuring the organization and practices of changing Inuit relations, and its participation in the establishing of dynamic relationships which replay the biological parental relation by initiating an identification mode made possible by inclusion-exclusion dynamics.</p>

            </strong>The study of various naming practices used with &quot;abandoned&quot; children in Burkina-Faso makes it possible, as if one were using a magnifying glass, to broach the children's identity representations and the processes whereby these identities are erased and &quot;recreated&quot;. I will attempt to account for these naming practices as well as for the absence of names given to these children, and even, in some cases, their renaming. I will base my conclusions on interviews carried out with families planning to put a child up for adoption, with the staff in the orphanages and with social workers. I will present the various people who give names, the power relations underlying certain re-naming practices in orphanages, the religious affiliations they entail, the importance that parents allot to their child's keeping their family name, the reasons which lead some parents to refuse to name their child, and finally the &quot;secret&quot; names some mothers give their children.</p>

            Based on work carried out on Arabic and Berber populations, and more specifically on the Arabic speaking populations of Mauritania, this talk will explore the meanings behind given names. We will explore the relations between given names and group names (family or tribe) – to what extent do names other than given names arise, and what are their origins? We will also explore new trends in the choice of names. These elements will also constitute the foundations for more general reflections on the linguistic specificities of proper names.</p>

            <strong>Sarah Leroy</strong> (UMR 7114 MoDyCo &ndash; Paris&nbsp;X)&nbsp;– <strong>Prénommer, c'est classer. Un exemple dans la presse française<br>
[To name is to classify. Examples from French newspapers]</strong> <br>
            For linguistics, people's names (as well as place names, the other main component of the name category) are proper names, a sub-category of names whose workings are quite specific, and where the question of meaning constitutes a crucial aspect. Linguistic approaches to the meaning of names can be either historical, etymological, and philological, i.e. an onomastic perspective, or they can be philosophical and referential, i.e. a logical-grammatical approach (as such, or through theoretical &quot;inheritance&quot;). Both approaches have their shortcomings. The first, even as it establishes the importance of proper names, not only for linguistics but also for other human and social sciences such as history and archeology, in fact attempts to &quot;go back&quot; to the very first lexeme, and thus back to the stage before the name came into being. The second approach, because it closely associates proper names and what they refer to (single entities no less), have trouble going beyond an &quot;encyclopedic&quot; conception of the meaning of proper names. Furthermore, whichever the approach, the high degree of heterogeneity in proper names is mostly ignored, whereas in French, for example, given names, patronyms, full names, nicknames, aliases, as well as all the various titles and honorifics which may be added, show very specific linguistic and social behavior. <br>
            Observing the workings and usage of names in speech and in texts shows that, alongside their designative function, which can only work if the name is associated with a specific referent, other functions are of a classifying order; for example those by which anthroponyms are integrated into social and classificatory systems and which may indicate religious affiliation or ethnic origins. It is from this angle, by clearly distinguishing between cases where the anthroponym is associated with a specific referent from those where it is not, that we will explore proper names, and more specifically given names, as they contain, like all other names, a semantic potential, even though their possibilities are slightly different from those of common names, and whose meaning, linked to the act of naming, is subjected to specific social and identity parameters. This proposition will be buttressed and illustrated by a case study based on a collection of newspaper articles.</p>

            <strong>Georges Drettas</strong> (LMS) – <strong>Un prototype de la glottonymie : les Grecs pontiques et leur vernaculaire en tant qu'objet verbalisable<br>
[A glottonymy prototype: the Pontian Greeks and their language variety as something which can be put into words]</strong><br>
            The Pontian Greeks were displaced from Western Turkey to Greece between 1924 and 1926. The majority of this population settled in northern Greece, Macedonia and Thrace, in rural areas. The Pontian-Greek variety is vastly different from the varieties upon which the current national language is based (sometimes called dhimotiki). I will present the workings of the naming systems used to refer both to the Pontians themselves and to their language. My observations are based on fieldwork studies where I asked people: 'speak to me in Pontian please'. Examining this type of situation, one sees that the relations to be found between the ethnonym and the glottonym(s) constitute a discursive reality which reflects the complex identification strategies where one finds heteronymy on one hand and group protection on the other hand. The symbolism present in the various naming usages in this case shows highly conflicting relations between those who were &quot;displaced&quot; and their so-called &quot;host&quot; country. In the discussion, we will attempt to discover whether some of the traits can be generalized, either within the near-eastern context, or more largely within refugee groups.</p>

            <strong><a href="../membres/coyaud.htm">Maurice Coyaud</a></strong> –<strong> Termes d'adresse en japonais, coréen, vietnamien, chinois, siamois <br>
            [Terms of address in Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese and Siamese] </strong><br>
            It is a well known fact that in Vietnamese, &quot;personal pronouns&quot; do not exist. With the family and close relatives, kinship <strong>terms</strong> are used. For example: I am an older brother. To address my little sister I say <em>anh</em>; inversely, if I am the little sister, I say <em>em</em>. When I speak to my parents, I use <em>con</em> (small child) for the English 'I'; when I address my father, I use the word for &quot;father&quot;.<br>
            In Korean, there are no fewer than eleven degrees of politeness, with infixes and suffixes on the verb indicating where the speaker stands in relation to the interlocutor. The situation in Japanese is similar to that of Korean, although slightly less complex.            <br>
            In Chinese, the variety of &quot;personal pronouns&quot; used to be very large. More recently, they have been simplified. For example, there is now only one degree of politeness for the 2nd person singular, i.e. there is no longer a polite form of &quot;you&quot; (contrary to French and German for example): <em>ni</em> &quot;you&quot; (2nd person neutral singular and plural form) vs. <em>nin</em> &quot;you&quot; (polite form).<br>
            In Siamese, terms of address follow various criteria such as proximity/distance (formal/intimate), superiority/inferiority.<br>

            This talk will describe work in progress consisting in the systematic analysis of a vast corpus of biographical data (the baptisms, marriages and deaths recorded for the inhabitants of the Sainte-Catherine de la Fossembault parish over the period 1832-1922) as well as some oral testimonies. After presenting the materials, we will then use them to extrapolate how given names are transmitted, especially among the Parish's Irish migrants and their descendents. This will also allow us to identify how their usage differs from that of Sainte-Catherine's &quot;local families&quot;. Thus migratory dynamics and intercultural phenomena will inform our exploration of naming practices in this seminar.</p>

            [First names and terms of address in Cambodia. Individuals and their spheres of affiliation]</strong><br>
            Based on research carried out in Cambodia between 1990 and 1995 (qualitative and quantitative research based on a name corpus), I will begin with a description of the various personal names people have (official given name, &quot;patronym&quot;, of post-colonial introduction, nickname, pet name) and the way in which they inform us as to the structuring of a Khmer individual's various social spheres (the Khmer being Cambodia's largest ethnic population). I will look closely at the changes wrought during the Pol Pot period (1975-1979), notably the appearance of quite a few Lenins – a name which is particularly suited to Khmer euphony – and on the important information to be drawn from the length of given names, as markers of social status. Terms of address, or reference, or of self-referral will furnish additional information on the socio-political evolution of Cambodia (where each successive political regime left its traces in the names). Lastly we will explore how the choice of one name rather than another among the various possibilities enables very fine grained sentiments to be expressed in face to face communication.</p>

            This presentation is based on a chapter from my PhD dissertation on kinship as it is experienced and presented among the Yolngu (better known as the Murngin in the anthropological literature). We will pay particular attention to a diagram painted by a Yolngu leader in 2002 to represent access to knowledge through various categories of relatives (the so-called &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, &quot;maternal grandmother&quot;, &quot;sister&quot; clans) and to illustrate the role of social organization in the classification and responsibilities linked to ritual heritage. Each clan has its own repository of terms inherited from their creator ancestors, and given names make up part of strategic ritual alliances linked to the sacred geography of the surrounding landscape. I will also explore in particular the characteristics of the märi-gutharra relation, between maternal grandparents and grandchildren, also known as the backbone.</p>

            <strong>Lorenzo Brutti</strong> (CNRS)&nbsp;– <strong>Les anthroponymes informels comme indice de la bilinéarité à Ciago (Trentin italien)<br>
[Informal anthroponyms as indicators of bilinearity in Ciago (Italian Trentino)]</strong> <br>
            The anthroponymic system in this village society of the Italian Alps consists in a set of markers which delineates the social space. The analysis of the system sheds light on some of the more obscure points as well as on some misunderstandings concerning Italian Trentino society, and clarifies these societies, usually classified as patrilinear, especially the filiation mechanisms through denomination. Kinship groups, rather than lineage, are name groups: given names, family names, nicknames, men's names, women's names, which the group members pass on to their successors, perpetrating them over generations. Belonging to one of these local groups brings certain privileges: transmission of riches, land and real estate, transmission of one's name, transmission of one's home. My goal is to show how the reproduction of the cultural order and estate transmission follow, for the society under study, through naming rather than through filiation.</p>

            [Attributing personal names among the Adelbert Range Hinihon (Papua-New Guinea)] <br>
            </strong>Why is it that only two people living among the Hinihon are allowed to bear the same name? The transmission and use of personal names are strictly regulated and, among other factors, much is done to avoid speaking someone's name. By analyzing these rules and how name giving is described in the local language, it becomes possible to understand the personal and social aspects contained in a name. </p>

            <strong><a href="http://www.ivry.cnrs.fr/lau/article.php?id_article=124">Marie Treps</a></strong> – <strong>Le romeno lap, un révélateur identitaire [The <em>romeno lap</em>, revealer of identity]</strong><br>
            The <em>romeno lap</em> is the onomastic system used in certain gypsy societies. Without being exactly a secret name, the <em>lap</em> is secreted by the community. Fieldwork carried out in Lorraine has shed light on current usage concerning what is also known as the &quot;Sinti name&quot;. What functions does this name fulfill? How is it given? Does its use evolve over time? What are its semantic motivations? Apparently usage of the <em>romeno lap</em>, and especially the fact that it cannot be transmitted, are deeply linked to Sinti culture. The analysis of contemporary usage shows some evolution which, as it is often linked to large scale phenomena, such as Pentecostalism, transcends specific communities. Nonetheless, each community contributes to the evolution of the romeno lap in its own way, thereby reinforcing its singular character. <br>

              In northern Romanian villages, magic is still very much in people's minds, despite the progress of modernity. Especially among the women. While it is easy to protect oneself against the evil eye (charms, rituals, incantations), falling victim to a spell is much more dangerous for people, their marriages, their possessions, their animals, their health. The person one goes to see to have the spell removed is called a &quot;witch&quot; (<em>bosoarca</em>), a term she refuses to bear, and a role she refuses to admit to, except before those who have come to seek her services, and only after swearing to secrecy within a ritual exchange (of the type gift/counter gift). Here I propose to analyze narratives by two &quot;witches&quot;, their attempts at fleeing and denying their powers when faced with the ethnographer, the talk of the villagers and those who have recourse to their services.</p>
