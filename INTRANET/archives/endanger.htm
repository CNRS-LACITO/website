<LI><I>Objective</I><P>


Approximately 6500 languages are currently spoken world-wide. It can be assumed that around two-thirds of these languages will become extinct in the 21st Century. All languages are intimately interlinked with the culture of their speakers, and all languages and cultures represent specific expressions of human thought and social organisation. Therefore, with every language which becomes extinct priceless intellectual values will be lost forever. Neither national or international cultural authorities, nor the relevant academic disciplines have so far developed the capacity to make use of what may well be the last opportunity to ensure the comprehensive documentation of even just a few languages.<P>


The Volkswagen Foundation hopes that its funding initiative will contribute towards stemming this irretrievable loss. In view of the foreseeable fact that some languages will rapidly become extinct within a mere one to two generations, systematic documentation would appear to be the task which most urgently needs to be tackled. Such documentation should be characterised by three key terms: data orientation, multifunctionality and general accessibility.<P>


The exemplary character of the programme does not only pertain to the final product of the documentation of individual languages, but also to developing and testing new methods of researching, processing and archiving linguistic and cultural data. It is intended that these methods should have a model character and that it should also be possible to utilise them for the purpose of documenting other language families. The programme has a strong interdisciplinary orientation: it not only supports interdisciplinary data collection, it also intends to create opportunities for subsequent multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary utilisation of the respective data.<P>


<LI><I>Structure of the Programme</I><P>


The programme will be divided into a twelve-month initial phase and a subsequent main phase in which projects for documenting endangered languages will be implemented. In parallel with this a multimedia database project providing technical language documentation support will be initiated.<P>


Up to six pilot projects with explorative functions will be supported during the initial phase of the programme. Between the degree of the endangerment under which a language functions and the urgent need for its documentation on the one hand, and its comprehensive documentation capacity for the purpose of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary utilisation on the other, these projects will elaborate the minimum requirements for documenting an endangered language; they will establish methodical standards for the collection of data which is as authentic as possible and design the contents of the database on the basis of partial sets of documentation. In order to be able to develop innovative concepts of wide-ranging validity, it is intended that the languages which are selected should belong to different language families. It will be possible to incorporate the outcome of pilot projects into main phase documentation.<P>


During the course of the main phase multiyear documentation projects, field research visits for the purpose of multimedia data collection will alternate with the computer-aided processing of such data, the objective being the compilation of sets of exemplary documentation of endangered languages.<P>


The implementation of and cooperation between the projects will be facilitated by the above-mentioned database project which is supposed to furnish a multimedia represantation format for the sets of documentation and to provide professional solutions to any data digitalisation and archiving problems which may occur. In addition, it will safeguard the transfer of knowledge between the initial and main phase projects. Finally, besides storing every single set of documentation on CD, this project is intended to elaborate a universally accessible language documentation archiving solution fulfilling three objectives: archiving is intended to be a permanent operation, preferably effected on a centralised basis and, if possible, utilisable via the Internet.<P>


<LI><I>Profiles of the Documentation Projects</I><P>


It its intended that every documentation project should collect, process and archive data for (at least) one endangered language.<P>


In this connection, a language shall be deemed to be endangered if, especially for political and economic reasons, its language community has ceased to speak it in public in favour of the language of the surrounding dominant culture. As a rule, the status of such a language deteriorates to that of a "home language" until, finally, its native speakers adopt the externally conveyed negative attitude towards it and cease to pass it on to their children.<P>


Every set of language documentation should be preceded by a brief linguistic description of the language at issue with regard to its probable genetic affiliation and an outline of the social and historic situation of the language and its language community. The actual documentation should be conceived as a corpus of primary data representing as many different types of texts as possible. In addition, it may also encompass other systematically collected data on the actual language community. It is intended that such sets of documentation should be presented in writing, on tape, pictorially and - if possible - on video.<P>


The intention is that - in line with the data orientation criterion - the material which is collected should be processed into a documentation set which is distinct from the conventional style of describing language, i.e., primarily in terms of grammar and vocabulary. <I>Inter alia</I>, it should encompass the following components as secondary data: an outline of the phonetic system; a practical orthography; a linguistic depiction of the language data which has been collected at the morphological/syntactic level represented in a morpheme-interlinear transcription; a free translation of the documented and transcribed texts; descriptive and explanatory remarks on every kind of text and language situation; specially collected lexical data; a collection of morphological forms (e.g. inflexion paradigms); informant questionnaires for the purpose of clarifying particular aspects.<P>


The data should be presented in an inter-theoretical format. It must be processed to such an extent that it can not only serve as the basis for linguistic research, but also - in line with the requisite multifunctionality feature - for analyses within the framework of other disciplines. For this reason it is intended that the data collection should encompass linguistic phenomena as part of an extensive cultural and social complex.<P>


For the purposes of general availabilty and permanent utilisation of the data it will be necessary for it to be digitalized, transferred to a multimedia representation format and archived in such a manner that it is generally accessible.<P>


<LI><I>Project Requirements</I><P>


During the initial and main phases the support of documentation projects within the framework of this programme shall be contingent upon the following conditions:<P>


<UL>


<LI>The degree of endangerment of the language which is to be documented, the urgency of its need for documentation and its comprehensive documentation capacity shall be evidenced.<P>


<LI>The qualification of the project members for language documentation purposes shall be demonstrated. Such project members should be qualified academics, preferably from a variety of disciplines (e.g. ethnology/linguistics), with field research experience. If possible, they should possess sufficient knowledge of the relevant contact language. Projects which are implemented within the framework of international, academic collaboration, particularly including academics from the host country, will be especially welcomed.<P>


<LI> In addition, a willingness to process data in accordance with the three key  terms of data orientation, multifunctionality and general accessibility is considered to be a prerequisite. Following the completion of the project, the project members will be granted the sole right of access to their data material for a period of up to three years for the purpose of achieving and presenting their own research results - e.g. in the form of a doctoral thesis.<P>


<LI> When an application is submitted, an official research permission and the consent of the relevant language community to the documentation of its language should have been obtained.<P>


<LI>The institutional prerequisites for the organisational implementation of the documentation project for which an application is submitted should be in place. Possible centralised archiving notwithstanding, responsibility for the general accessibility of the documentation and continued data maintenance will lie with the applicants.<P>


<LI> A willingness to attend conferences within the framework of the programme will be assumed provided that such conferences do not clash with field research visits.<P></UL>


In the case of the pilot projects during the initial phase, a willingness to pass on the operationalizable results will additionally be expected. On the one hand, this will include the submission of a concluding report two months following the completion of the project and, on the other, participation in a workshop for the purpose of evaluating the results and experiences and rendering them utilisable for the main phase.<P>


<LI><I>Delimitation</I><P>


Orientation towards the documentation of endangered languages in the form of data corpora is a central criterion for assignment to the programme. Therefore, projects for the documentation of non-endangered languages, projects relating to already well-documented languages, projects involving more theoretical or methodical objectives, and projects for which linguistic documentation is linked or subordinate to other objectives, such as missionary objectives, which may lead to the loss of the cultural traditions of a language community are excluded.<P>


In accordance with these objectives, projects whose main objective is the compilation of dictionaries or grammar books without extensive collections of texts, and projects involving languages whose decline is so advanced that they do not permit comprehensive documentation involving collections of texts, are not  excluded, but will be given low priority.<P>


<LI><I>Funding Possibilities</I><P>


In accordance with the structure of the programme the following may be funded:<P>


<UL>


<LI>Initial phase: pilot projects involving a maximum duration of twelve months for the purpose of documenting data material from various language families which, for the most part, already exists; provision of funds to cover personnel costs, travel allowances, particularly for field research, and equipment as well as consumables.<P>
