<LI><I>Objectives</I><P>


At the beginning of the 1990s the Volkswagen Foundation established "Das Fremde und das Eigene - Problems and Possibilities of Intercultural Communications" as a priority area. The initiative was launched in view of a contradictory development: on the one hand, the growing internationalization of the world with numerous intercontinental economic, academic and cultural relations, and, on the other, growing intolerance, exclusion and even hatred of "foreigners" and "foreign" cultures; the trend towards worldwide assimilation and networking, on the one hand, an increasing lack of "intercultural competence", on the other. In the meantime, the resulting problems in political, social and cultural life have, if anything, become even more urgent. Academic research thus also finds itself under growing pressure to utilize its potential and opportunities to establish improved prerequisites for intercultural understanding, communications and conduct.<P>


The Foundations's support has hitherto focused on issues of (inter-)cultural competence and interaction, especially with respect to the internal German problem areas of relations with migrants (including schools, municipal districts, the police, the judicial authorities). However, the impending changes at both the academic and the socio-political levels are providing new challenges for research. This is particularly the case with regard to the structural change discussed in terms of the keyword "globalization", and the attendant transnational interconnections, which bring about ever new forms of conceptualization, combination and intermixture of "foreign" and "native". Thus, for example, the question arises as to what extent identities can emerge within the framework of the globalization trends beyond territorial and cultural loyalty and which relevance is, in this context, ascribed to ethnic minorities. Questions of transnationality and transculturalism are also on the agenda.<P>


In order to meet these new requirements, the Volkswagen Foundation has reconceived this priority area. It wishes to support research analysing the processes outlined above, and thus also contributing towards the development of new political and social perspectives.<P>


<LI><I>Thematic Scope</I><P>


Intercultural encounters as well as cultural dissociation are neither a specific achievement nor an exclusive problem of the late 20th Century. What, however, appears to be a novel feature is the scale, dynamics and explosiveness of such processes, and thus also the extraordinarily strong public interest which they attract. There seems to be a broad consensus now that these processes are extremely multifaceted and - particularly in conjunction with political, social, and economic developments - far more complex than is suggested by descriptive terms like "encounter". Accordingly, the conviction has intensified that the key concepts applied in this field of research require no less reflection than the phenomena which researchers are trying to investigate with their assistance. Apparently, this is the case with key concepts such as "culture", "identity", "interculturalism", "foreign" and "native" - to name but a few - which are by no means ‚fixed parameters'. On the contrary: as recent studies have shown, they themselves are largely ‚construed' - in other words: they themselves seem to be the variable outcome of just such processes of continuous encounter, dissociation, conciliation, intermixture, and superimposition of different cultures. Investigating these processes and their momentum of change, analysing their premises, conditions, framework, structures, and effects theoretically as well as empirically and with the necessary historical reflection, and thus illuminating them in a problemoriented perspective - this is the thematic scope of the reconceived priority area. Accordingly, projects which pursue these objectives and address these central points of interests will be given priority.<P>


The following topics may serve as examples: transformations of cultural identity-shaping and their dynamics; cultural (self-)perception processes within new transnational structures; changes in addressing cultural features in everyday social life; new options for immigration policy: between cultural integration and transcultural opening; national identity and ethnic difference - (dual) citizenship and cultural selfperception; new media and the presentation of cultural identity; knowledge and knowledge transfer in the intercultural perspective; historical and systematic analyses of key concepts (including "culture") and key categories.<P>


<LI><I>Project Requirements</I><P>


Within the framework of this priority area research projects can be supported if they - in line with the objectives depicted above - can be expected to bring about a more profound insight into significant processes of intercultural dissociation, mediation and identity-shaping. In this regard, projects involving practical references and perspectives, and projects which consider the aspect of gender are welcome.<P>


The cultural features of the key concepts underlying each research project should be expounded in the project application and discussed with respect to their acceptability and scope. It is expected of applicants that, in addition to the reception of the current state of the respective national and international research, special importance should be focused on an explicit consideration of one's own methodology and its suitability for an analysis of "foreign" cultures.<P>


The Foundation is particularly interested in international/intercultural and - insofar as necessitated by the subject matter - interdisciplinary cooperation which should be expounded in detail in the application and be comprehensible from the work schedule which is to be submitted.<P>


Especially in the case of historically oriented projects, the participation of experts on the regions which are addressed is required, and in the case of projects primarily concerned with historical and systematic reviewing of key concepts and categories, intercultural cooperation.<P>


It is important to the Foundation that project results are discussed within the framework of an interdisciplinary symposium involving German and non-German representatives from the respective academic and practical fields. In addition, the presentation and conveyance of results in university teaching and to the public is particularly desired. Research applications should contain proposals in this regard.<P>


Projects without an interdisciplinary or international/intercultural character cannot be funded.<P>


<LI><I>Funding Possibilities</I><P>


Funds can be provided for:<P>


<UL>


<LI>Research projects (by provision of funds to cover personnel expenses, scholarships, running and non-recurrent expenditures, including travel allowances, also for cooperating with foreign partners). Scholarships can only be awarded in the context of a research project.<P>


<LI>Scientific meetings involving a limited, interdisciplinary and international group of participants, including such meetings abroad (besides, the provisions of the "Symposia and Summer Schools Programme Area" apply).<P>


<LI>Single-term stays at German universities on the part of teachers of Asian, Latin American and African origin for the purpose of conveying indigenous "non-Western" academic concepts. German academic institutes at which such stays are intended to be spent may apply for this. In addition to travel costs up to DM 3,500 can be budgeted for foreign academics staying in Germany for the first month and up to DM 3,000 per month for longer stays.<P>


</UL>


<LI><I>Applications</I><P>


Written applications may be addressed to the Volkswagen Foundation at any time and without any particular format requirements. In view of the fact that the Foundation is particularly interested in an interdisciplinary, intercultural/ international cooperation applications should be jointly submitted by the respective partners. In principle, applications from abroad are equivalent to German ones although, in order to be considered, they must also demonstrate a defined cooperation with academic institutions and scholars in the Federal Republic of Germany.<P>


Project applications should be formulated clearly and contain the following information:<P>


<OL>


<LI>Short, informative title of the project<P>


<LI>Abstract (1 - 2 pages, summarizing the objectives and substantiation of the project and its implementation, i.e. the respective methods and procedures.)<P>


<LI>Detailed project depiction: reasons and objectives; methodical approach (including methods and details of the intended type of data analysis, evaluation, and interpretation); if applicable, hypotheses; source basis; current state of national and international research<P>


<LI>Working programme and time schedule<P>


<LI>Information on interdisciplinary cooperation and intercultural/international contacts<P>


<LI>Results expected; scientific relevance of research approach and potential for practical application<P>


<LI>Applicant's previous work on the subject<P>


<LI>Calculation and substantiation of costs itemized in terms of personnel costs, (academic personnel, other personnel, scholarships), running costs (travel expenses and other running costs, e.g. consumables), non-recurring material expenses (equipment and other non-recurring purchases, e.g. literature). Computer equipment requirement would need justifying in detail. In the case of personnel, insofar as project members are named not only the grade of the post for which an application is being submitted should be stated, but also the amount which is actually necessary (including ancillary costs) on the basis of the prevailing valid collective pay agreements; otherwise average rates should be stated. Personnel funds for foreign partners should be estimated at the standard rates of the relevant country.<P>


<LI>Indication of whether this or a similar application has been submitted to any other funding institution<P>


<LI>Name of proposed recipient of grant<P>


<LI>Curriculum vitae and list of publications of the key participants and their responsibilities in the project.<P>


</OL>


The project description (see 1. to 10. above) should not exceed 15 pages (1 1/2 -spaced).<P>


Applications for funding of expert meetings should also contain information about<P>


<UL>


<LI>the scientific programme of the event, the papers to be presented, and the time schedule;<P>


<LI>the place, date, and duration of the proposed event;<P>


<LI>the (tentative) list of participants and speakers and approved registrations (at least of those presenting papers).<P>


</UL>


Further Requirements<P>


The Foundation can provide funds only to academic institutions. Applicants who are not members of universities or of well-established research institutes should also supply details on the legal status, statutes, trustees and boards, charitable status, budgeting and auditing of their respective institutions. Non-institutionalized project groups will be asked for detailed information on their legal and organizational status. If available, applicants are required to supply an annual report or a general description of their institutions.<P>
