  <p align="left"><strong>6.5 The European Reference Index for the Humanities (ERIH)</strong><br>
    The problems of citation analysis discussed above has led the European Science Foundation (ESF) to explore an alternative model in its project to produce a European Reference Index for the Humanities (ERIH). In particular, in response to concerns that existing citation indices too rarely included the best journals published in languages other than English, the ESF&rsquo;s Standing Committee for the Humanities (SCH) has sought to compile its own database of scholarly journals in the humanities.</p>
  <p align="left">The ERIH has four self-proclaimed aims:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to increase visibility for humanities research in Europe<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to disseminate European research in the humanities worldwide<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to encourage best practice in the publication of humanities journals<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)to provide a benchmarking tool for comparisons at aggregate level<br>
    In pursuit of these goals, the ERIH has produced listings of journals, broken down into three categories: A, B and C. The definitions of these categories are as follows:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Category A: high ranking international publications with a very strong reputation among researchers of the field in different countries, regularly cited all over the world.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Category B: standard international publications with a good reputation among researchers of the field in different countries.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Category C: research journals with an important local/regional significance in Europe, occasionally cited outside the publishing country though their main target group is the domestic academic community.</p>
  <p align="left">Details of the project can be found at<br>
    www.esf.org/research-areas/humanities/activities/research-infrastructures.html</p>
  <p align="left">It has been stressed that in producing its classification of journals, the ESF is not seeking to make or presume judgements of quality but rather to identify the scope and general interest of different journals, distinguishing between those that were highly specialist and those that were general.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The distinction between categories A, B and C is not primarily qualitative; rather, the categorisation is determined by a combination of characteristics related to scope and audience. Journals have different profiles, and their scope of audience and field vary. Papers in journals with wide international prestige are not automatically of higher quality than papers in journals which are known and read only in a very specialised field.&rdquo;(ESF/ERIH website)</p>
  <p align="left">We understand the desire of those producing the ERIH to overcome the limitations of existing citation approaches, but as we have looked at the ERIH&rsquo;s own approach, we have identified a number of problems. Some of these problems are matters of implementation, which could be overcome with further development, but other problems raise questions about the conceptual foundations of the approach:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The statement on the ESF website (quoted above) to the effect that the classification is not intended as a ranking of quality is incompatible with the way in which the classes are defined. For example, journals in the A category are said to have &lsquo;a very strong reputation&rsquo; whereas those in the B category have &lsquo;a good reputation&rsquo;. It is difficult to read these definitions without taking them as quality rankings.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It is not clear what the relationship is between citation information and ranking by putative journal esteem. The criteria refer to journals on the A list as being &lsquo;regularly cited all over the world&rsquo;, but there is no independent citation information given to support this assessment. It would have been helpful if the classifications had been systematically related to existing citation measures, so that a comparison could have been made between the two approaches.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Although the panels devising the classifications were made up of scholars distinguished in their own field, the number of such scholars is small. There are techniques of journal classification that use the judgements of a much larger number of people. For example, Garand and Giles have set esteem measures alongside citation measures for journals in Political Science. The advantage of using the judgements of a relatively large number of people is that individual errors in classification are cancelled out.</p>
  <p align="left">We were concerned lest our own response to the ERIH initiative reflected a narrow set of methodological pre-occupations, so we asked Academy Fellows for their views of the &lsquo;initial lists&rsquo; for their disciplines. Box 6.1 gives some examples of the comments received. These comment suggest that the methodological worries that we have complement the substantive concerns of those who are expert in specific disciplines and sub-disciplines.<br>

      <td><p><em>Box 6.1: Comments from Fellows regarding the ERIH &lsquo;initial lists&rsquo; for their disciplines</em></p>
        <p>&ldquo;Especially problematic in this connection is the fact that Category C in this exercise is different in kind from A and B in that it is devoted to &lsquo;journals of local and regional significance in Europe&rsquo;. If it is felt necessary to distinguish a category of journals in this way, it would be better to give them a different type of label, perhaps calling them simply &lsquo;Local&rsquo; rather than C. In this way their distinct status is recognised but there is no implication of hierarchy with respect to journals in the other two categories. This is important because often the journals in the C list are the leaders in their field. To take an example, Studi di Filologia Italiana has been in existence for more than half a century and has numbered some of the most eminent scholars in Italian textual philology and historical linguistics amongst its editors and contributors, including many from outside Italy. Inevitably, however, Italians figure most prominently since it is - not surprisingly - within Italian universities that this discipline finds a particular concentration of research excellence. And for this it is rewarded with a classification as C!&rdquo; (comments from Fellows of <strong>the</strong> <strong>Academy&rsquo;s Linguistics Section</strong>.)</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I have major problems with the criteria: they relate more to language and distribution than to the intrinsic quality of the contents of these journals. So if the journal is in English, or predominantly so, and in consequence has the possibility of wide circulation and wide citation it has a higher chance of getting A than if it is not in English. But this has really nothing to do with quality. A case in point is Tarbiz. This is in Hebrew so its readership is limited, but among core researchers I the field of Jewish Studies it is a major journal and should be in the highest category.&rdquo; (comments from Fellows of <strong>the Academy&rsquo;s Theology<br>
  and Religious Studies Section</strong>.)</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There is a clear preference to rank English journals as A but no measures of impact or scholarly standing are offered in support. Moreover, nearly all the US Journals listed here receive an A grade. This seems to go against the stated aim which was to question the ISI bias towards US/English journals.&rdquo; (comments from Fellows of <strong>the Academy&rsquo;s Archaeology Section</strong>.)</p>
        <p>&ldquo;An anomalous consequence of the ERIH methodology is that the same journal may get two or more different rankings within different subject lists, if it is deemed to be &lsquo;central&rsquo; in one field and &lsquo;peripheral&rsquo; in another....&rdquo; (comments from Fellows of <strong>the Academy&rsquo;s Linguistics Section</strong>.)</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Continental musicology is a much more narrowly defined and traditional field than its British and North American equivalent.... as a result, the categorisations in this list [Musciology] reflect what most British and American musicologists would consider an entirely outmoded concept of the discipline.&rdquo; (comments from Fellows of <strong>the Academy&rsquo;s History of Art and Music Section</strong>.)</p></td>

  <p align="left">We conclude that the European Reference Index for the Humanities as presently conceived does not represent a reliable way in which metrics of peer-reviewed publications can be constructed. We suggest that alternative approaches are needed to deal with the problems. These alternative approaches might include the following.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Analysis could be conducted of journals that are not currently included in Thomson Scientific&rsquo;s citation indices, but are nonetheless cited in the journals that are included. These cited-only journals may provide evidence of quality that is neglected in current measures.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Academic communities could be consulted widely about their perceptions of journal quality using electronic communication. There is no reason why such an approach should be regarded as an alternative to the classification produced by a small group of experts, but it would provide some comparative reference point of assessment.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>6.6 Conclusions and Recommendations</strong></p>
  <p align="left">Metrics and peer review are related in complex ways. This partly reflects the extent to which peer review describes many diverse practices. Metrics are typically summary measures of peer reviewed activities, and the use of metrics sets up incentives to change behaviour in ways that affect peer review.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>R6</strong> Care should be taken to ensure that any metrics employed reflect the distinctive nature of the humanities and social sciences research and do not have an adverse affect on the quality of the work that they are seeking to measure. HEFCE should commission an investigation to explore whether there is scope to modify the Thomson Scientific indices to accommodate the special features of humanities and social science research. Until this work is completed and assessed, metrics should remain an adjunct to the research assessment (RAE) panel peer review process rather than a substitute.</p>

  <p align="left">Difficulties with existing metrics have led to attempts to develop alternative approaches, notably the European Reference Index for the Humanities (ERIH) that involves the ranking of journals. However, the Working Group identified a number of methodological difficulties with the ERIH approach, relating to reliability and validity, some of which were fundamental.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>R7</strong> The experience of the European Reference Index for the Humanities (ERIH) shows how difficult the task is, and we conclude that the ERIH does not at present represent a reliable way in which summary measures of peer reviewed publications can be constructed.</p>
